The wedding ceremony will take place in the **morning June 8<sup>th</sup>**, so it is important that you are at the venue by that time :)

### Wedding day +/- 1

* Cora and Edo will provide accomodation **for the nights before and after the wedding day** in a walking distance from [the party venue] (http://www.santuariodelmirteto.it/).

* You will be contacted by the organisers soon to sort out accomodation arrangements for these days (number of nights, people etc).

* If you have arranged your own accomodation, [please let us know](mailto:caviranipots@gmail.com).

There is not much alternative accomodation within Ortonovo, but some options are available in Carrara/Marina di Carrara and Massa/Marina di Massa.

### Travelling around

If you are interested sighseeing the area before/after the wedding, these are some accomodation ideas and hopefully useful links:
