* While most of giests will have rooms in some B&B or Holiday houses in the wedding village (Ortonovo) for the week-end of the wedding, the oroganisers are looking for some other solution for all the people. As soon as we'll have more info we'll let you know.
* For who's brave enough to camp, the organisers will find some nice spot with access to water, wc, etc.. (most likely in the garden of Edo's grandmother.
