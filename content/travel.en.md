### Venue

Ortonovo

### Public transport and cars

Getting to Ortonovo.

* The closest airport is Pisa; furthermore is really easy to take a train from Pisa to Carrara-Avenza.
* the closest station to the wedding's place is "Carrara-Avenza" or (for some un-local trains) "Massa Centro".
* The wedding place is 15 min far by car from the train station. Unfortunately is quite difficult to reach Ortonovo by bus from the train station, but Cvirani's family and Leonard Cavirani are available for trasporting peolpe by car from the station to Ortonovo (and viceversa) for arrivals and leavings.
